# cs 441 - multiple view

This app is simply adding the additional interfaces to the game I made for project 3. This time, there is a title screen, with the high score on the main screen and clicking the button "START GAME" brings the player to the second screen - instructions.


There lies a scrollable table view with an explanintion of the game and what to do. At the bottom right, there is a "READY" button that the player presses to start the game. When the player dies, they get an option to go back to intro screen or instructions screen.

The game is inspired by my girlfriend who loves sushi and wishes that they rain from the sky, and thus the inspiration for the game.
